This folder contains a set of csv files named by years corresponding to the year-folders in the project root.

each csv files contains multiple `;` - separated rows of data, with columns containing the following info:
`git-project-id;human-readable-project-name-ie-title` 

Have a look at `DUMMY_3000.csv' for reference. It only contains examples, which will not be accessble and for which the script will not work.

When creating a new overleaf project, just add a corresponding line to the corresponding year's file.
